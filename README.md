# üìä HR Analysis

## üìÇ Introduction

This project focuses on analyzing HR data to gain insights into factors affecting employee promotions. The dataset includes information such as education level, department, gender, recruitment channel, training scores, age, previous year ratings, KPIs met, awards won, and more.

## üîç Step 1: Collect Data

### Data
The project utilizes two datasets: `train.csv` and `test.csv`. The `train.csv` dataset contains information about employees, including their attributes and whether they were promoted or not. The `test.csv` dataset is used for making predictions based on the insights gained from the analysis.

## Installation
To run this analysis, you need to have R and the following libraries installed:

- `tidyverse`
- `dplyr`
- `ggplot2`
- `lubridate`
- `janitor`
- `readr`

### Clean Data
Duplicates are removed from the train data to ensure data integrity.

## üìà Step 2: Analyze and Visualize Data

### Variables vs. Promotion
Visualizations are created to analyze various variables against promotion status, including:
- Education
- Department
- Gender
- Recruitment channel
- Number of trainings
- Average training score
- Age
- Previous year rating
- Length of service
- KPIs met >80%
- Awards won
